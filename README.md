# Seriput

An experimental **distributed in-memory cache** written in **Java 25**, built to learn about distributed consensus.
The long-term goal is to run a small cache cluster using the **Raft algorithm** for replication and fault tolerance.

**Project Goals:**
- Simple single-node cache server with a custom binary protocol
- Java client library with connection pooling
- Gradually evolve into a Raft-backed distributed system
- Explore concepts like leader election, log replication, and snapshots

This project exists purely for experimentation and learning.
